Proposal Introduction
Our project will focus on a fashion-based app designed to make getting dressed easier and more fun for individuals. While providing simplicity to the dressing process, the app will allow users to express their unique fashion style by prioritizing personal preferences. The app will also aim to appeal to a wide range of users looking to streamline part of their daily routine. By allowing users to take pictures of their clothes and add them to a virtual wardrobe, the app helps organize outfits and offers suggestions based on personal style and current weather conditions. Users can also receive tailored recommendations depending on the occasion and plan outfits in advance by syncing with their calendar for special events or trips. The app will even suggest complementary items to enhance existing wardrobe pieces with links to online stores. Our app provides a convenient solution for users to effortlessly receive stylish outfit choices for their everyday needs.

Problem to Address
In today’s world, many individuals struggle with choosing outfits each day, which can be stressful and time-consuming. For example, students and adults can find it frustrating to search for a new outfit to wear every morning before heading off to school or work. Factors like busy schedules, limited wardrobe options, and changing weather can make it difficult to decide what to wear. Also, some individuals find it challenging to mix and match clothes that suit their personal style or that fits the occasion they are dressing for. As a result, they may end up wearing the same outfits repeatedly or feeling dissatisfied with their choices. Individuals may also resort to excessive shopping because they struggle to find new outfits to wear from their existing wardrobe, leading to unnecessary spending. Our fashion app aims to solve these problems by providing personalized outfit suggestions, helping users feel more confident and excited about their daily wardrobe choices. 

Background
 	There are a few products (mobile or web applications) that already exist that are somewhat similar to the app we’re creating. Typically, they allow the user to add photos or take a photo with a built-in camera function, identify specific features using AI or allow you to manually add the features, and those clothes would be stored in a closet. There were a few apps that were similar to the proposed app, but the three apps that were focused on are Acloset, Smart Closet, and Open Wardrobe. All of these apps allow you to share your outfits to other individuals on the app and show clothes you can buy through different stores outside the app. The first app that was researched is Acloset. Acloset is an app that allows the user to take photos from their phone’s photo gallery or take a new photo by using the app’s built-in camera. It then would use AI to first remove the background of the picture and then detect the specific features of the piece of clothing including colors, brands, and what seasons it would be best for and store it in a closet, which enables the user to use AI to style outfits using them.(Acloset). This is similar to OpenWardrobe, which uses LolaAI to style outfits(Open Wardrobe). Smart Closet is different from the other two fashion apps because while it does have the same features as the other two, it focuses more on clothing online from different brands and suggests them so that you can style them and buy them through the app (“Smart Closet: Your Personal Stylist”). These apps have created a fairly competitive market for those interested in fashion and for those who don’t really know fashion.
We have seen various applications and software that deal with fashion and closet management. Yet, the biggest question is: what sets our app apart from the rest? Compared to typical apps, which base styles and outfit ideas on seasons, occasions, or what might go together, we would allow the user to add clothes and then check which ones fit together to match a niche style. For example, if the user wanted to try a gothic style, the app would be able to check the user’s closet and check if they have anything that fits that style or suggests clothes online that would help fit that style. Another unique feature is our clean vs. used clothes sorter, which distinguishes between your closet and your hamper. After wearing an outfit suggested by the app, those articles of clothing will move to your “hamper.” This ensures that worn items aren’t included in outfit recommendations while in the hamper. Once you wash your clothes, you can empty your hamper, and your closet is full once again. Our app is a valuable tool that not only simplifies the process of styling outfits based on personal closets and the weather, but it also allows users to embrace their unique fashion identity and to express themselves creatively.

Technical Discussion
Core Requirements
	The core requirements for our fashion app focus on the essential features that will provide users with a convenient and personalized experience. Users must be able to take photos of their clothes, categorize them, and create a virtual wardrobe. This is an important feature since it forms the foundation for all our other app features. The app must also offer tailored outfit suggestions for various events, ranging from casual to formal, so users can easily find the right outfit for any occasion. Also, it must recommend weather-appropriate outfits by using local weather data, so users dress for the day’s conditions. Saving and tracking past outfits with photos and dates is another important feature, as it allows users to revisit their favorite looks without having to remember or repeat the process of choosing an outfit. Another core feature is the ability to plan outfits for specific events by syncing with the user’s calendar, which will help them stay organized. The app should also suggest complementary items from online retailers, offering users the chance to enhance their wardrobe. Our app stands out with two unique features, which include style-based recommendations and a virtual hamper to track dirty clothes. The style-based recommendations offer personalized outfit suggestions based on specific fashion trends, such as streetwear or vintage, allowing users to explore and express their unique style. The virtual hamper feature helps users track which clothes have been worn, so they can easily avoid suggesting dirty items in future outfit recommendations until they are marked as clean. We prioritize our features using the MoSCoW method. The Must-Haves are the ability to take photos of clothes to create a virtual wardrobe, offer tailored outfit suggestions for various events, recommend weather-appropriate outfits, and track past outfits with photos and dates. The Should-Haves include the ability to plan outfits for specific events by syncing with the user’s calendar and a virtual hamper feature to track dirty clothes. The Could-Haves include style-based recommendations on niche fashion styles and suggesting complementary items with links to online retailers. The won't-have feature is the ability for users to see outfits on themselves virtually using augmented reality.

User Story Discussion 
	For our fashion app, the user story revolves around making the process of choosing outfits easier and more convenient for users. The goal is to help users dress confidently by providing personalized outfit suggestions without requiring too much time or effort. Our high-level story states: As a user interested in fashion and convenience, I can view outfit suggestions based on my wardrobe and style preferences, so I can dress confidently without having to spend much time deciding.
	To achieve what our high-level story states, we break the high-level story down into several sub-stories that focus on specific functionalities. The app allows users to upload photos of their clothes, which the app will categorize into sections like tops and bottoms. This helps organize the wardrobe so users can easily view and select items when choosing an outfit. Users will also have the ability to set their style preferences so that the outfit suggestions match their personal fashion aesthetic. Also, the app will use weather data to recommend weather-appropriate outfits, so users can dress according to the day’s conditions without needing to check the forecast.
	For special events, users will be able to input details about the occasion and receive outfit recommendations that are appropriate for those situations. The app also lets users plan their outfits ahead of time by syncing with their calendar, which helps them stay organized and prepared for upcoming events or trips. To further boost the user's wardrobe, the app will suggest complementary items from online stores, giving users an easy way to discover new pieces that fit their style. Users will also be able to save past outfits with photos and dates, so they can easily revisit their favorite looks without having to remember what they wore previously.
	These sub-stories are important for creating a user-friendly fashion app that meets the needs of users who value both style and convenience. By breaking down the high-level story into 
manageable parts, we can confirm that each feature is clearly defined and can be prioritized during development.

High-Level UML Diagrams
Activity Diagram: 
The following activity diagram for the fashion shows all the key processes and interactions a user will have in order to manage their wardrobe and receive outfit recommendations. The flow of this diagram begins with the user logging in or registering. This allows the user access to the app's features. Once the user has been logged in, they can take photos of the clothes in their wardrobe. All of these clothing items will then be saved in a virtual wardrobe where they shall be organized. Users are allowed to manage their wardrobe and are able to sort items into categories such as clean clothes or used clothes. A feature of the app is to give personalized outfit suggestions based on various factors such as, being able to sync with a weather app and suggest an outfit based on the weather. Also it would be able to sync with a calendar app and suggest outfit recommendations based on the event. It can also suggest an outfit based on a certain aesthetic. 

ER Diagram:
	The following is an ER diagram that shows the possible database structure for the fashion app. The user registers into the app and adds details like category, color, fabric, status (whether clean or used). Users can thus create outfits from these clothing items based on a recommendation system that syncs with multiple API’s and a machine learning algorithm. This database also ensures that a single item can be used with multiple outfits.

Use Case Diagram:
	The following use case diagram was used to show the actors in the system. In this use case diagram, the only external actor is the user but there are other internal actors such as the Firebase back-end and APIs which do specific functions to help make the app run. Since Firebase can be the database and the back-end server, every main action can run through it. Each API helps give information about the style, which is then used by the Firebase back-end to help recommend an outfit based on style, weather, event, or if they want to plan an outfit.

Research Completed
	For the frontend of our fashion app, our group plans to use Dart with the Flutter framework. Dart is a simple, powerful programming language made for building fast apps that work on multiple platforms. It lets us write one set of code that can run on both iOS and Android, which is important because we want our app to be available to as many users as possible (Dart, 2024). Flutter, which is built on Dart, makes development faster and helps us create a user-friendly interface with smooth animations. The “hot reload” feature in Flutter lets us instantly see changes we make, making development faster and helping us improve the app’s design (Flutter, 2024). Flutter has pre-made tools and widgets that make building features like organizing wardrobes and showing outfit ideas quicker and easier. Also, Flutter’s helpful documentation and a supportive community will make it easier for us to learn, solve problems, and build our app more efficiently. By using Dart with the Flutter framework, we can create an app that runs well, looks good, and provides users with an enjoyable experience while interacting with the features of our fashion app. 
	For the backend of our fashion app, we will use Firebase because it provides a powerful and easy-to-integrate solution for storing and managing data, user authentication, and other essential app features. Firebase offers a variety of services, including Firestore for real-time database management, Firebase Authentication for secure user sign-ins, and Firebase Storage for storing images (Firebase, 2024). These features will help our app manage user accounts, store photos of the virtual wardrobe, and suggest personalized outfit recommendations efficiently. Using Firebase with Dart and the Flutter framework makes the development process simpler because Firebase offers software development kits (SDKs) that are well integrated with Dart, allowing us to easily connect the app's frontend to the backend. The Flutter framework helps build a responsive cross-platform user interface and Firebase integrates well with it to manage both the frontend and backend of the app efficiently. This combination will help us focus on creating an ideal user experience while Firebase takes care of the backend complexity.
            We also looked into the APIs we could use for the project. For the calendar API, we plan to use Google Calendar API because it contains a simple structure that will allow clients to easily plan outfits using the calendar ("Google Calendar API Concepts"). We needed an API which would style clothes in the closet by different features including color and so we chose FashionCloud API (“Fashion Cloud API v2”). While this can be changed, it is good because it can help identify clothes that are on the market, allowing for an easy experience when the user adds clothes to their wardrobe. Another important feature we included was the ability to know the weather to plan outfits for the coming days. That’s why we chose OpenWeatherMap API (“Weather API”). This API allows the user to know the weather in the near future for up to 8 days. The data the API gives is also human readable, helping the users understand the weather without having to deal with complicated data. 
	For the image recognition feature, we felt an AI was best and so using the Firebase backend for the image recognition works well since it can identify specific features in an image. While this needs more research, especially since we haven’t worked with Firebase before, we plan to experiment with the Firebase ML Kit since it seems to be the best on the market at the moment (“Image Labeling”).

Tentative Project Schedule
	Our tentative project calendar for the Spring 2025 semester is divided into six 2-week sprints, with the last two weeks reserved for presentation preparation and final adjustments before submission. In Sprint 1 (Weeks 1-2), we’ll set up the project by creating the repository, configuring the development environment, designing the basic layout and navigation, and setting up user authentication and database connections. This will make sure that our project is ready for the next phase. Sprint 2 (Weeks 3-4) will focus on building the virtual wardrobe feature, allowing users to upload and categorize their clothes. We will also begin developing the outfit suggestion feature based on personal style, weather, and occasion, and implement a system to track worn clothes in a hamper. Sprint 3 (Weeks 5-6) will build upon the previous sprint by refining the outfit suggestion system, adding more personalized recommendations based on preferences and calendar events. We will also enhance the style-based recommendation feature, like suggesting outfits for specific trends. In Sprint 4 (Weeks 7-8), we will add our calendar feature for users to plan outfits ahead of time and introduce our shopping feature to recommend items from online stores based on the user’s wardrobe and style. Sprint 5 (Weeks 9-10) will focus on refining core features, fixing bugs, and improving the user experience. We will also begin testing the app and gathering feedback. Sprint 6 (Weeks 11-12) will involve thorough testing, possibly beta testing with real users, and final improvements based on feedback. We will also begin preparing for our presentation at the Scholarship and Creative Works Conference, making sure that we can successfully demonstrate the app’s features. In Week 13, we will focus on preparing for our presentation by finalizing the app, rehearsing the demo, and making any last-minute improvements based on feedback. In Week 14, we will complete final touches, finalize the documentation, and prepare for submission. This schedule will hopefully guide us through the development process and help us stay on track during the Spring 2025 semester.

Conclusion
In conclusion, our group set out to make an application that would help users understand fashion and gave them a chance to explore it themselves by using what is already in their own closet. We also researched specific features such as weather and calendar details to let users easily plan outfits based on weather and occasion. At the same time, more research we want to look into is how exactly we would use AI and APIs in Firebase without complicating the connections and process of the system. We aim to create an intuitive, user-friendly app that simplifies fashion decisions and improves users' daily dressing experience.
